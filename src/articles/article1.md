Are You Numbling to Startup Failure?: The Unseen Pitfalls Of "Visionless" Businesses in Nigeria


“Aje o! Aje a wa!”
This is a common saying amongst people of the Yoruba tribe that non-literally translates to “May you sell” or “May the gods of trade and prosperous sales show luck and kindness to you”.
The Nigerian business landscape is a fascinating paradox. More often than not, many business owners mistake mundane loyalty for long-term success; they operate on shaky ground, fueled by assumptions about attracting customers and basking in short-lived fame from trendy business practices. They mistake fleeting loyalty for long-term success, and mistake prayers for sound strategy. 
 On any given weekend, you'll see throngs of hopeful entrepreneurs fervently praying for a miraculous business breakthrough at religious gatherings. In due course, they start to ask rhetorical questions like: “Oh, why has God forsaken me?” “am I not praying enough?” “Or is God testing beyond my endurance?”. While faith undoubtedly plays a role, the calculated and predictable approach reigns supreme in achieving sustainable growth and fulfilment. 

What truly defines a successful business? 
One of the most profound definitions describes it as “an establishment with the capacity to repeatedly and predictably service a growing demand for unique products and services”. Emphatically, the words “predictability” and “repeatability” outline the crucial role of vision and strategy in navigating the fierce competition of the Business terrain.
The Nigerian business landscape is a brutal battleground. While only a few brands rise to become industry titans, the vast majority are locked in a desperate struggle for survival. This relentless fight for scraps leaves little room for innovation, vision, or building something truly remarkable.

The Problem: Hunger, Not Vision, Drives Most Startups
Let's be honest. For many Nigerians, entrepreneurship isn't a passionate pursuit, it's a desperate scramble for survival. Empty stomachs don't breed brilliant ideas; they breed short-term thinking and a laser focus on making any money possible, fast. This approach might keep the lights on today, but unfortunately, it's a recipe for disaster tomorrow.
According to statistics, we have approximately 40 million SMEs and 39 million MSMEs in Nigeria. A survey was conducted asking 500 entrepreneurs why they decided to start their business and the vision they had in mind kicking off with the business. 70% of them said they started the business to be their own boss, 20% said they were out of job, while the rest 10% related it to skill and passion.
This survey underscores the diverse “motivations” behind entrepreneurship in Nigeria, ranging from economic necessity to personal fulfilment and independence. 

The Vicious Cycle of Visionless Businesses
Let’s see the trajectory of a business lacking a clear vision in practical terms:
Short-Termism: Blinded by the need for immediate cash, visionless businesses neglect long-term strategy. They sacrifice customer loyalty and brand differentiation for a quick buck.

Lack of Purpose: No clear "why" means no clear direction. Without a guiding purpose, businesses are rudderless ships, tossed around by market forces with no control over their destiny.

Customer Disconnect: When a brand has no vision or purpose, it's impossible to connect with customers on an emotional level. This leads to low engagement, high churn, and ultimately, failure to stand out in a crowded marketplace.

What are the consequences?
These visionless businesses are like cancer cells in the Nigerian economy. They stifle innovation, drag down industry standards, and create a race to the bottom. This "survival of the fittest" mentality ultimately hurts everyone.

The Wake-Up Call: Rethinking the "Go-It-Alone" Myth
The traditional "bootstrap yourself to success" narrative falls flat in the harsh realities of the Nigerian market. For many, the path to success lies not in blind solopreneurship, but in collaboration.
The Ultimate Options For Escape Are:
Government Intervention: The government needs to step up and create a more supportive ecosystem for startups. This includes access to funding, mentorship programs, and infrastructure development.

Strategic Partnerships: Entrepreneurs need to embrace the power of collaboration. Partnering with established businesses or successful individuals within your chosen industry can provide invaluable guidance, mentorship, and access to resources. This collaborative approach can be the difference between surviving and thriving.

The Choice is Yours: Vision or Oblivion
The Nigerian business landscape is a land of stark contrasts. It can be a land of incredible opportunity and innovation, or it can be a graveyard of failed dreams and wasted potential. The choice is yours. Whether you succumb to the allure of short-term gains and become another statistic, or you choose to build a brand with a clear vision and a purpose that extends beyond mere survival.
The time for blind ambition is over. The time for strategic vision is now.
